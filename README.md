# Cell Tracks to Ovito 

Converts cell tracking data into animations, created using Ovito, a piece of software used for visualising and simulating particle dynamics in chemistry [ovito.org](https://www.ovito.org/). Here's a (bad) example of an animation made using Ovito:

Ovito can be run using Python scripts. We're using this functionality here because it allows easy replication of figures. 

## Basic Idea:

Ovito accepts file formats more typical of computational chemistry (.cif, .xyz, etc.). Cell tracking data (and associated gene expression) are typically stored in .csv or .xlsx files, so we need a way to convert the raw data to a file format readable by Ovito. Here I use .xyz, as it's the most straightforward. 

An .xyz file (at least as read by ovito) assumes the first three columns are the cartesian coordinates x, y, z. Ovito can also read a fourth column, which my code reads out as the colour of the particles in Ovito. You can thus visualise cell attributes such as gene expression and identity by entering numeric values into this column. I have not tried a fifth column, so it may be possible to store more information in the file, but it is my current belief that only one column can represent particle colour so adding extra information may be redundant (unless we know cell radii, etc.). 

[tracks_to_xyz.py](tracks_to_xyz.py) will convert a .csv file with cartesian coordinates for cell nuclei over time into a folder of .xyz files, each representing a snapshot of embryo at a specific time. This folder is then read by Ovito in [to_ovito.py](to_ovito.py) to an animation. You can tweak the aesthetic parameters for Ovito (frame rate, colours, particle size, renderer, etc.) in this script, as well as the file format for the animation. Ovito allows .mp4, .avi, .mov, and .gif formats. Alternatively specifying a .jpeg or .png file will create a series of image files, one per frame. 

## Open Issues:

This is far from a smooth and clear workflow, so for now I will focus on allowing easy adjustment of the aesthetic parameters, and clarifying the python scripts so that users may easily animate their data with minimal coding.
